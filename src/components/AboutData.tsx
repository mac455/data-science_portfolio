                <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computing at Edge Hill University, where Iâ€™ve gained comprehensive skills in data analysis, visualisation, machine learning, web development and cybersecurity. 
                <br/> Additionally, I recently completed a 16-week coding bootcamp with CODE Lancashire, further enhancing my skills in full-stack development with technologies such as React, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind, Next.js, and Python.

                 I have worked on both personal and collaborative projects.
                 Data mining/visualization of several online datasets using Python, applying machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and regression. 
                <br/>As part of a team, we built a Student-Tutor Management App (Django, PostgreSQL, Tailwind), a Boxing Gym website (React), a To-Do List app (React). 
                These projects have helped me develop strong programming skills while honing key soft skills like teamwork, communication, organisation, and time management.

            <p>
             My certifications in IT Help Desk, SIEM, ISO 27001 Compliance, and cloud computing demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
             <br/>In my previous roles at Pfizer and Merieux NutriSciences, I developed a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving skills while overseeing quality control in high-pressure environments. 
             As the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) champion at Pfizer, I managed the calibration and upkeep of essential lab equipment, requiring attention to detail and the ability to troubleshoot complex systems, skills 
            I am confident will transfer well to technical challenges of a role in tech.
