          I&apos;m a 23-year-old data analyst and web developer. 
          I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computing at Edge Hill University, where Iâ€™ve gained comprehensive skills in data analysis, visualisation, machine learning, web development and cybersecurity. 
         <br/> Additionally, I recently completed a 16-week coding bootcamp with CODE Lancashire, further enhancing my skills in full-stack development with technologies such as React, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind, Next.js, and Python.

          I have worked on both personal and collaborative projects.
           Data mining/visualization of several online datasets using Python, applying machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and regression. 
           <br/>As part of a team, we built a Student-Tutor Management App (Django, PostgreSQL, Tailwind), a Boxing Gym website (React), a To-Do List app (React). 
           These projects have helped me develop strong programming skills while honing key soft skills like teamwork, communication, organization, and time management.
